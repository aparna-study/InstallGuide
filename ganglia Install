Ganglia main components:

 Ganglia Monitoring Daemon (gmond)
It is a lightweight service that is installed on every machine you’d like to monitor.
Gmond has four main responsibilities:

Monitor changes in host state.
Announce relevant changes.
Listen to the state of all other ganglia nodes via a unicast or multicast channel.
Answer requests for an XML description of the cluster state.
Each gmond transmits in information in two different ways:

Unicasting or Multicasting host state in external data representation (XDR) format using UDP messages.
Sending XML over a TCP connection.
 Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad)
The ganglia meta daemon (gmetad) is a service that collects data from other gmetad and gmond sources and stores their state to disk in indexed round-robin databases. Gmetad provides a simple query mechanism for collecting specific information about groups of machines.

Ganglia PHP Web Front-end
The Ganglia web front-end provides a view of the gathered information via real-time dynamic web pages. Most importantly, it displays Ganglia data in a meaningful way for system administrators and computer users using PHP.

Other component are:
Gmetrics
The ganglia metric tool is a commandline application that you can use to inject custom made metrics about hosts that are being monitored by ganglia. It has the ability to spoof messages as coming from a different host in case you want to capture and report metrics from a device where you don’t have gmond running (like a network or other embedded device).

Gstat
The ganglia stat tool is a commandline application that you can use to query a gmond for metric information directly.


Create epel repo file to install ganglia

[root@master-ganglia-cm ~]# wget http://mirror.pnl.gov/epel//6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

[root@master-ganglia-cm ~]#rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Install gmetad , web , gmond, ganglia on a master node

[root@master-ganglia-cm ~]# sudo yum install ganglia ganglia-gmetad ganglia-gmond ganglia-web

Starting gmond daemon at boot:
chkconfig --level 345 httpd on
chkconfig --level 345 gmond on
chkconfig --level 345 gmetad on

Now there must be something in this gmond.cof file which will tell this gmond to send its metric data to our collector server gmond (master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net). So we need to have the below entries in gmond.conf file. changed only name in cluster and host=master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net where this is host where gmetad service is running.

udp_send_channel {
#bind_hostname = yes # Highly recommended, soon to be default.
# This option tells gmond to use a source address
# that resolves to the machine's hostname. Without
# this, the metrics may appear to come from any
# interface and the DNS names associated with
# those IPs will be used to create the RRDs.
mcast_join = 239.2.11.71
host=master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net
port = 8649
ttl = 1
}


cluster {
name = "my-cluster"
owner = "unspecified"
latlong = "unspecified"
url = "unspecified"
}



Started gmond daemon :
[root@master-ganglia-cm ~]# sudo /sbin/service gmond start
Starting GANGLIA gmond: [ OK ]

Update configure this file where “master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net” would be your host on which you are running this service
[root@master-ganglia-cm ~]# sudo vi /etc/gmetad.conf

data_source "my-cluster" master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net:8649

Starting gmetad daemon:
[root@master-ganglia-cm ~]# sudo /sbin/service gmetad start
Starting GANGLIA gmetad:


Configure /etc/httpd/conf.d/ganglia.conf file for the following changes
vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ganglia.conf

#
# Ganglia monitoring system php web frontend
#

Alias /ganglia /usr/share/ganglia

<Location /ganglia>
Order deny,allow
# Deny from all
# Allow from 127.0.0.1
# Allow from ::1
# Allow from .example.com

[root@master-ganglia-cm yum.repos.d]# /etc/init.d/httpd restart
Stopping httpd: [ OK ]
Starting httpd: httpd: apr_sockaddr_info_get() failed for master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net
httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
[ OK ]
[root@master-ganglia-cm yum.repos.d]#

Install gmond daemon on all other node:

[root@nn ~]# sudo yum install ganglia-gmond
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror
Determining fastest mirrors
epel/metalink

the above command will do the following things.

this will install the gmond binary. this binary is located /usr/sbin/gmond
You can create the default gmond configuration file with gmond binary.
This will also install the gmond daemon which will continuously collect metrics from the machine.

Now there must be something in this gmond.cof file which will tell this gmond to send its metric data to our collector server gmond (master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net). So we need to have the below entries in gmond.conf file.

udp_send_channel {
#bind_hostname = yes # Highly recommended, soon to be default.
# This option tells gmond to use a source address
# that resolves to the machine's hostname. Without
# this, the metrics may appear to come from any
# interface and the DNS names associated with
# those IPs will be used to create the RRDs.
mcast_join = 239.2.11.71
host=master-ganglia-cm.Mydomain.net
port = 8649
ttl = 1
}


cluster {
name = "my-cluster"
owner = "unspecified"
latlong = "unspecified"
url = "unspecified"
}

[root@nn ~]# /etc/init.d/gmond start
Starting GANGLIA gmond: [ OK ]
[root@nn ~]#

sudo /sbin/chkconfig --levels 235 gmond on


Accessing web UI
when you hit url as http://host/ganglia in my case it's "http://192.168.1.161/ganglia"

Error while accessing ganglia web UI
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access ganglia server

Try editing file  /etc/sysconfig/selinux for following changes


# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
# enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
# permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
# disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
# targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
# mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted


When you hit web url now if you'll get error as 

There is error collecting ganglia data fsockopen error: permission denied

Then check for logs in place /var/log/messages

Oct 7 19:53:26 master-ganglia-cm /usr/sbin/gmond[1410]: update_ifdata(BO): 4.61168e+17 4.61168e+17 4.61168e+17 4.61168e+17 / 40.0001
Oct 7 19:54:45 master-ganglia-cm /usr/sbin/gmetad[1828]: Please make sure that /var/lib/ganglia/rrds is owned by ganglia

So change owner of /var/lib/ganglia/rrds to ganglia and you will see the following result when you hit url as http://host/ganglia in my case it's "http://192.168.1.161/ganglia"
